# SmileShift

**SmileShift** is an innovative deep learning project aimed at simulating post-operation dental modifications, specifically visualizing the appearance of a patient's teeth after undergoing a cosmetic dental procedure, such as the "Hollywood Smile." By focusing on the facial and dental landmarks, SmileShift reconstructs and visualizes the altered teeth region while retaining the original facial features.

## Overview

**SmileShift** leverages deep learning techniques to assist in:
- Reconstructing a post-dental operation image using facial landmarks.
- Focusing primarily on the teeth region and aligning it with pre-operation images.
- Providing a real-time visualization tool for patients to preview their dental procedure results.

The model integrates computer vision techniques with MediaPipe FaceMesh for identifying facial landmarks and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for generating realistic post-operation teeth visualization.

## Installation

To run **SmileShift**, you'll need Python 3.x and several dependencies. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Dependencies:
- `torch`
- `numpy`
- `Pillow`
- `tqdm`
- `opencv-python`
- `mediapipe`

You can add the rest of the dependencies in your `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WaleedAlzamil80/SmileShift.git
   cd SmileShift
   ```

2. Prepare your dataset (see [Data Preparation](#data-preparation)).

3. Train the model using:
   ```bash
   python main_vae.py
   ```

4. Visualize the output:
   You can visualize the reconstructed images using the provided utility functions in `Utils/`.

## Model Details

The **SmileShift** project uses a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** to learn the underlying representation of facial images and reconstructs the teeth area after a simulated cosmetic procedure. The model focuses on manipulating and improving the teeth region while keeping other facial regions intact.

### Key Components:
- **FaceMesh (MediaPipe)**: Used to extract facial and dental landmarks (lips and teeth regions).
- **VAE**: Learns latent representations of images and generates modified post-operation visualizations.
- **Masks**: Masking is applied to focus the reconstruction on the teeth region.

## Data Preparation

1. Store your images in a directory specified in the `Dataset/dataloader.py` file.
2. Make sure each image has a corresponding mask that focuses on the teeth area.
3. The mask is generated dynamically by `process_single_image()` in the DataLoader using MediaPipe FaceMesh landmarks.

### Data Structure:
- **Images Directory**: Contains images to be used for training and testing.
- **Partition Data**: A CSV file listing the paths to the images.

## Training

The training process involves running `train.py` to optimize the VAE model. You can control training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs via arguments or modifying them directly in the script.

### Sample Training Command:
```bash
python main_vae.py --num_epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

### Training Workflow:
- Images are loaded and masked by the DataLoader.
- The VAE model is trained to reconstruct the post-operation image using the masked input.

## Visualization

To visualize the reconstructed images and their corresponding masks, you can use the utility functions provided in `Utils/utils.py`. These functions help you plot images, masks, and reconstructed outputs for comparison.

```python
from Utils import utils
utils.plot_image_tensor(image_tensor)
```

## Results

By the end of training, SmileShift can generate realistic post-operation images of teeth for patients. The reconstruction process ensures that the output is visually consistent with natural facial features, allowing patients to preview their new smile.

### Example Output:
- Original Image
- Masked Image (teeth region)
- Reconstructed Image
